              Specialist and generalist pathogens may exert different costs on their hosts; thereby altering the way hosts cope with environmental variation. We examined how pathogen-challenge alters the environmental conditions that maximize host performance by simultaneously varying temperature and nutrition (protein to carbohydrate ratio; P:C) after exposure to two baculoviruses; one that is specific to the cabbage looper,
              Trichoplusia ni
              (TnSNPV) and another that has a broad host range (AcMNPV). Virus-challenged larvae performed better on more protein-biased diets, primarily due to higher survival, whereas unchallenged larvae performed best on a balanced diet. The environmental conditions that maximized host performance differed with virus identity because TnSNPV-challenge inflicted fitness costs (reduced pupal weight and prolonged development) whereas AcMNPV-challenge did not. The performance of TnSNPV-challenged larvae rose with increasing P:C across all temperatures, whereas temperature modulated the optimal P:C in AcMNPV-challenged larvae (slightly protein-biased at 16 °C to increasingly higher P:C as temperature increased). Increasing temperature reduced pupal size, but only at more balanced P:C ratios, indicating that nutrition moderates the temperature-size rule. Our findings highlight the complex environmental interactions that can alter host performance after exposure to pathogens, which could impact the role of entomopathogens as regulators of insect populations in a changing climate.},

To facilitate research on this pest, it is important to formulate and formalize a suitable artificial diet based on local ingredients. In this study, the life histories of fall armyworm reared on corn leaves and four artificial diets were recorded. The four artificial diets used were: soybean and sucrose-based (SS), soybean and wheat germ-based (SW), chickpea and wheat germbased (CPW), and corn and soybean-based (CNS). The intrinsic rates of increase were 0.1957, 0.1981, 0.1816, 0.1748, and 0.1464 per day in the fall armyworm populations fed corn leaves, CNS, SW, CPW, and SS, respectively. The highest fecundity (F = 1225.4 eggs per female) and net reproduction rate (R0 = 544.7 offspring per individual) were observed for the fall armyworm reared on the CNS diet. Moreover, the developmental rate, survival rate, and fecundity were used to calculate the projection of the population growth. Projection results showed that the fall armyworm populations can increase considerably faster when fed the CNS diet compared with the other diets. In addition, the mass-rearing system showed that the most efficient and economical strategy would be to rear the fall armyworm on the CNS diet. The results indicated that the CNS diet was the most suitable diet for the fall armyworm mass rearing.},

Additionally, when considering long-term trends driven by climate, one must account for large-scale oscillations including El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). We combine long-term datasets of grasshopper abundance, climate, plant biomass, and end-of-season foliar elemental content to examine potential drivers of abundance cycles and trends of this dominant herbivore. Annual grasshopper abundances in 16- and 22-y time series from a Kansas prairie revealed both 5-y cycles and declines of 2.1–2.7\%/y. Climate cycle indices of spring ENSO, summer NAO, and winter or spring PDO accounted for 40–54\% of the variation in grasshopper abundance, mediated by effects of weather and host plants. Consistent with ND, grass biomass doubled and foliar concentrations of N, P, K, and Na—nutrients which limit grasshopper abundance—declined over the same period. The decline in plant nutrients accounted for 25\% of the variation in grasshopper abundance over two decades. Thus a warming, wetter, more CO

                  While rising global temperatures are increasingly affecting both species and their biotic interactions, the debate about whether global warming will increase or decrease disease transmission between individuals remains far from resolved. This may stem from the lack of empirical data.
                
                
                  
                    Using a tractable and easily manipulated insect host–pathogen system, we conducted a series of field and laboratory experiments to examine how increased temperatures affect disease transmission using the crop‐defoliating pest, the fall armyworm (
                    
                      S
                      podoptera frugiperda
                    
                    ) and its species‐specific baculovirus, which causes a fatal infection.
                  
                
                
                  
                    To examine the effects of temperature on disease transmission in the field, we manipulated baculovirus density and temperature. As infection occurs when a host consumes leaf tissue on which the pathogen resides, baculovirus density was controlled by placing varying numbers of infected neonate larvae on experimental plants. Temperature was manipulated by using open‐top chambers (
                    OTC
                    s). The laboratory experiments examined how increased temperatures affect fall armyworm feeding and development rates, which provide insight into how host feeding behaviour and physiology may affect transmission.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Disease transmission and outbreak intensity, measured as the cumulative fraction infected during an epizootic, increased at higher temperatures. However, there was no appreciable change in the mean transmission rate of the disease, which is often the focus of empirical and theoretical research. Instead, the coefficient of variation (
                    CV
                    ) associated with the transmission rate shrunk. As the
                    CV
                    decreased, heterogeneity in disease risk across individuals declined, which resulted in an increase in outbreak intensity.
                  
                
                
                  In the laboratory, increased temperatures increased feeding rates and decreased developmental times. As the host consumes the virus along with the leaf tissue on which it resides, increased feeding rate is likely to increase the probability of an individual consuming virus‐infected leaf tissue. On the other hand, decreased developmental time increases the sloughing of midgut cells, which is predicted to hinder viral infection.
                
                
                  Increases in outbreak intensity or epizootic severity, as the climate warms, may lead to changes in the long‐term dynamics of pests whose populations are strongly affected by host–pathogen interactions. Overall, this work demonstrates that the usual assumptions governing these effects, via changes in the mean transmission rate alone, may not be correct.},

	abstract = {Cannibalism in the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) (FAW), is a limiting factor in a baculovirus production system. To detect the impact of cannibalism, a two-step bioassay was conducted with different larval ages of FAW fed on two food sources (corn and castor bean leaves) contaminated with the S. frugiperda multiple-embedded nucleopolyhedrovirus. In a first bioassay, the food source affected the cannibalism, being higher for all larval ages tested (5-, 6- and 7-day-old larvae) in larvae fed on corn than on those fed on castor bean leaves. Larval mortality, weight equivalent and larval equivalents (LEs) per hectare decreased as the larval age increased. Larval weight, occlusion bodies (OBs)/larva and total OBs increased when the larval age increased. In a second bioassay, in which only 6and 7-day-old larvae were used because of the performance in the first bioassay, the cannibalism rates were affected by the interaction between food sources and time of feeding (48 and 72 h), reaching the highest values for 6- and 7-day-old larvae fed on corn leaves for 72 h. Mortality of the FAW was affected by the interaction between food sources, larval age and time of feeding. The lowest mortalities were on 7-day-old larvae when they were fed on castor bean leaves for 48 and 72 h. Larval weight, OBs/larva, total OBs and LEs were affected by the interaction between food sources and larval age. A significant correlation was observed between larval weight and OBs/larva that fed on both food sources, suggesting that larval weight can be used to achieve a concentration to be sprayed in 1 ha.},

To help use insecticides more sparingly, the functional response and intraspeciﬁc competition of the FAW larvae were evaluated under the laboratory conditions. The results showed that all stages of the FAW larvae displayed a type II functional response to diet. Based on Holling’s disc equation, the search rate (a) and handling time (Th) of sixth instar larvae (a = 0.493; Th = 0.37 min) were the highest, and the shortest of all larval stages, respectively. Intraspeciﬁc competition curves ﬁtted the data for fourth to sixth larval stages of the FAW, and the coeﬃcient of intraspeciﬁc competition (m) assessed by the intraspeciﬁc competition equation were highest for ﬁfth instar larvae (m = 0.48). The present study indicates that 5th and 6th instar larvae can cause the most plant damage (accounted for 88.9\% of larval consumption), and these stages should be the focus of any pest management strategy. Intraspeciﬁc competition, especially cannibalism, impacts the feeding patterns of the FAW larvae and needs close attention. Understanding the functional response and intraspeciﬁc competition of the FAW larvae contributes greatly to practical applications of insecticides, increasing the eﬀectiveness of chemical sprays and decreasing ecological damage.},

Unfortunately, experiments to determine long-term insect performance across plant cultivars are infrequently conducted. With that in mind, we report here the performance of Spodoptera frugiperda, the fall armyworm, on jasmonic acid (JA) induced/noninduced soybean cultivars. JA induction increases plant defensive compounds and can be considered an equivalent to a plant’s response to herbivory. S. frugiperda is a global pest, with infestations in soybeans becoming an emerging problem, making information on this pest’s performance on soybeans warranted. Thus, we reared larvae on two different soybean cultivars with contrasting defensive strategies when induced with JA and measured 7-day survival, development time to pupation, and pupal mass. Plant cultivar and JA induction were both important causes of mortality. Although plant cultivars varied in their amounts of constitutive/inducible defenses, this did not cause an interactive effect between plant cultivar and induction. Insect development to pupation was also extended when fed on induced plants regardless of cultivar, while pupal mass was not affected. Overall, induced plant defenses lowered larval survival and extended development time which would alleviate pest pressure and extend the period growers have for detecting infestations.},

To make clinical investigators familiar with Weibull regression model, this article introduces some basic knowledge on Weibull regression model and then illustrates how to fit the model with R software. The SurvRegCensCov package is useful in converting estimated coefficients to clinical relevant statistics such as hazard ratio (HR) and event time ratio (ETR). Model adequacy can be assessed by inspecting Kaplan-Meier curves stratified by categorical variable. The eha package provides an alternative method to model Weibull regression model. The check.dist() function helps to assess goodness-of-fit of the model. Variable selection is based on the importance of a covariate, which can be tested using anova() function. Alternatively, backward elimination starting from a full model is an efficient way for model development. Visualization of Weibull regression model after model development is interesting that it provides another way to report your findings.},
