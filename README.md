### Effects of macronutrient manipulation in artificial diet on fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) performance

    In this project, I experimentally tested the performance of fall armyworms (FAWs) on various artificial diets. I manipulated macronutrient levels, specifically protein-to-carbohydrate ratios, and reared the FAWs from beginning of larval stage until moth stage. I used R and RStudio to summarize, plot, and analyze results to identify significant trends. For more detailed Methods, please see the Final Report document within this project.
    This was the first step required to determine a significant difference in performance on these diets before moving on to further experiments. Next, I will be feeding these manipulated diets to FAWs then presenting them with the opportunity for cannibalism of infected conspecifics at various temperatures. The broad interest here is to investigate potential effects of resource quality and temperature on cannibalism and disease transmission in this system. For more information on background and future directions, see the Final Report.
